        Enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits
        (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is
        the same as gid, and username is the same as the primary group name.

        If set to yes, userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no
        more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name
        of the user.
